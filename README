Packages we use (which must be installed on the live system):
zorba - not installed on eniac...
zorba-security-module (for md5 hash function)
python-mysqldb

Data: To reset the database with a clean data image (our group's data and the
import data from the 3 other groups given to us), run the import.sh script
in the top-level directory.

Running the project:
As with the distributed homeworks, first please intsall the three packages 
listed above (as well as all the eclipse plugins specified for the homeworks).
Then open eclipse and import 'eclipse_import.zip' as a project. After that,
you should be good to go.
